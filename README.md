# memerank
i found myself needing to sort my massive memes folder by how funny i thought they were. so i made this thing that'll basically has my memes 1v1 eachother until theyre sorted.

# usage
place your memes into /static/memes/ then run the app. u need flask.

it takes a long fucking time to get through everything. 50 memes will take around 2k matches so yeah lmao.

at the end you'll have a json file in /data/ that's all the filenames and their elo's.
